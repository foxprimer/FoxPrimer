Install the following Perl modules and their dependencies by hand using CPAN:

	Catalyst
	Catalyst::Devel
	BioPerl
	BioPerl::Run
	
Before attempting to run the Makefile

After compiling Sim4, copy the executable sim4 to a directory that is in a system-wide shell $PATH

After compiling Primer3, copy the executable primer3_core to a directory that is in a system-wide shell $PATH
Also, copy the directory primer3*/src/primer3_config/ to /opt/ on a linux system. This has not been tested on OS X or Windows, however, these parameter files must be visible to the Catalyst engine, so YMMV.
