To install the FoxPrimer Catalyst program, you must have either a Linux or OS X computer.

This version will not work properly in Windows. There are no plans at this time to develop
this program for windows.

Installation instructions for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

These installation instructions assume you are starting with a clean installation of Ubuntu
12.04 LTS.

You must have root priveledges to install these packages and this program. Please check with
your system administrator if you do not.

Make sure your installation is up to date:

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Reboot the system (if you have installed many updates)

	sudo reboot

Install the make utility:

	sudo apt-get install make

Test the make installation:

	which make
	make -v

	- If these two commands return the path and version information
	  respectively, then installation went correctly.

Install the gcc compiler to help with C code compilation for Perl modules:

	sudo apt-get install gcc
	

Test the gcc installation:

	which gcc
	gcc -v

	- If these two commands return the path and version information
	  respectively, then installation went correctly.

Install the g++ compiler to help with C code compilation for Perl modules:

	sudo apt-get install g++
	
Test the g++ installation

	which g++
	g++ -v

Install the file utility Unzip:

	sudo apt-get install unzip

Test the Unzip installation:

	which unzip
	unzip -v

	- If these two commands return the path and version information
	  respectively, then installation went correctly.

Install the Primer3 primer design program:

	sudo apt-get install primer3

Test the Primer3 installation:

	which primer3_core
	primer3_core -v

	- If these two commands return the path and version information
	  respectively, then installation went correctly.

Install the Sim4 alignment program:

	sudo apt-get install sim4

Test the Sim4 installation:

	which sim4
	sim4 -v

	- If these two commands return the path and version information
	  respectively, then installation went correctly.

Install the SQL database program SQLite3:

	sudo apt-get install sqlite3

Test the SQLite3 installation:

	which sqlite3
	sqlite3 --version

	- If these two commands return the path and version information
	  respectively, then installation went correctly.

Install BedTools the suite of programs for BED file manipulation:

	sudo apt-get install bedtools

Test the installation of BedTools:

	which intersectBed
	intersectBed

	- If these two commands return the path and version information
	  respectively, then installation went correctly.

Install Git

	sudo apt-get install git

Install the Perl XML Parsing library:

	sudo apt-get install libxml-sax-expat-perl

Install the libpng developmental library:

	sudo apt-get libpng-dev

Install the GD graphics library perl wrapper

	sudo apt-get libgd-gd2-perl

Install the MEME suite of motif discovery and recognition tools

	wget http://meme.nbcr.net/downloads/meme_current.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf meme_current.tar.gz
	./configure
	make
	make test
	make install

Install the Kent source of tools for the UCSC Genome Browser:

	Download the Kent source:

		wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/jksrc.zip

	Unzip the Kent source:

		unzip jksrc.zip

	Remove the .zip file, it is no longer needed:

		rm jksrc.zip

	Determine your CPU architecture:

		uname -m

	The string that is returned should be a short string, such
	as: 'i386', 'i686', 'x86_64', 'sparc', or 'ppc'

	Store the string in the Bash variable $MACHTYPE:

		MACHTYPE=i686

		-or-

		MACHTYPE=x86_64

	Test that the $MACHTYPE variable has been stored correctly and is
	the same as the 'uname -m' command:

		echo $MACHTYPE
		uname -m

		The previous two commands should return the same string.

	Alternatively, this can be done in one step if the return of 'uname -m'
	is a short string as described above:

		export MACHTYPE=$(uname -m)

	Now that we have set the $MACHTYPE variable, the Kent source tree
	will place compiled utilities into $HOME/bin/$MACHTYPE. We must
	create this directory before compiliing any utilities:

		mkdir $HOME/bin
		mkdir $HOME/bin/$MACHTYPE

	This will be a minimal installation of the Kent source, if you would
	like to install the full Kent source tree, refer to:

		http://genome-source.cse.ucsc.edu/gitweb/?p=kent.git;a=blob;f=src/product/README.building.source

	First, we need to build jkweb.a:

		cd kent/src/lib
		make

	Second, we need to make stringify, which is required by some utilities to
	be compiled:

		cd ~
		cd kent/src/utils/stringify
		make

	Next, we need to make twoBitToFa, which will extract Fasta sequences from
	binary 2bit files:

		cd ~
		cd kent/src/utils/twoBitToFa
		make

	Now we should test the twoBitToFa executable to make sure that it has been
	compiled correctly:

		cd $HOME/bin/$MACHTYPE
		./twoBitToFa

		Running the executable should give usage information. If you do not
		see any usage information, please check the above steps to ensure
		that installation has gone correctly and that you did not receive
		any errors during compilation.

	Finally, we need to add the path to twoBitToFa to our Bash $PATH. To do this
	we will edit our .bash_rc file.
	Instructions below are for VIM, you can use your text editor of choice:

		cd ~
		vim .bashrc
		G 	# This command will bring you to the bottom of the file, it is optional
			# you can insert the following line anywhere in the file
		o	# This command enters insert mode on a new line
		export PATH="/home/jason/bin/x86_64:$PATH"	# Replace 'x86_64 with whatever
								# MACHTYPE your machine is
		<escape>	# The escape key exits insert mode
		:wq		# colon(:)wq and then enter saves and quits the file

	Once the file has been saved and you have exited your text editor shell, you need to
	resource the .bashrc file with the following command:

		source $HOME/.bashrc

	Now test to make sure that the correct path has been added to your Bash $PATH with the
	following command:

		echo $PATH

		This command should contain the string you just entered in your .bashrc file.
		If it does not, please go back and check to make sure you have executed the
		instructions properly.

		twoBitToFa

		The executable for twoBitToFa should be executable from anywhere now that the
		path to this program has been added to the Bash $PATH.

Now it is time to install the Perl modules needed to run the Catalyst Server and the dependencies
used in FoxPrimer.
